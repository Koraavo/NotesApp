Introduction:
This is the code repository for the java and web development course application requirement. The application is called Notes. It is a simple notes application with markdown possibilities.

The user needs to register himself and can then create his private notes.

It is a CRUD Application. This basically means that the user has the possibility to create, read, update and delete his notes.

The Application is built using the MERN Stack. MERN is an acronym for MongoDB (used as a database), Express (used on the server side), React used in the frontend and Node.js used in the frontend and the backend.
